# Personal Website Generator

A tool I built to help people quickly create a personal portfolio site. You fill in your info, and it generates a clean, ready-to-deploy website.

### How it works

Answer a few questions about yourself — your bio, work experience, projects — and the app generates static HTML/CSS files you can host anywhere. Preview your site before downloading.

### Run locally

```bash
cd website-generator
npm install
npm start
```
